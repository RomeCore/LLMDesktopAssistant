# NOTICE

This directory contains code derived from **Iciclecreek.Avalonia.Terminal**
(https://github.com/tomlm/Iciclecreek.Avalonia.Terminal),
Copyright (c) 2025 Tom Laird-McConnell, licensed under the MIT License.

The following files are copied from (or heavily based on) the original project,
with namespace renames and minor adjustments:

- `BufferCellExtensions.cs`
- `ProcessExitedEventArgs.cs`
- `TerminalExtensions.cs`
- `TerminalRenderThrottle.cs`
- `TerminalView.cs`
- `TitleChangedEventArgs.cs`
- `Win32ControlKeyState.cs`
- `WindowInfoRequestedEventArgs.cs`
- `WindowMovedEventArgs.cs`
- `WindowResizedEventArgs.cs`

## Modifications

- All types were moved from the `Iciclecreek.Terminal` / `Iciclecreek.Avalonia.Terminal`
  namespaces into `LLMDesktopAssistant.Desktop.Execution.Terminals`.
- `TerminalView` no longer manages the PTY process lifecycle (launch, reading, kill).
  Process creation, output pumping and termination are owned by
  `LLMDesktopAssistant.Desktop.Execution.ProcessLauncher` / `ProcessTerminalSession`;
  the view only renders the terminal buffer and forwards user input to the PTY.
- `TerminalControl` and `TerminalWindow` were not ported — they are not needed by
  this application.
